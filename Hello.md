***Hey I am Don***
 
- I am still fairly new to GitHub but understanding how it works would have been amazing for other projects in the past.
- I learned the basic ideas on how this repository, committing and pushing works. I think its a pretty cool system in which I wish I had used for my smart home project. 
- The idea of branches are nice since you can do parts of the build instead working on the whole main file and even better I can request for peers whom might be better suited for backend or front end to help trouble shoot. 
- I am having a good time coding and learning so far!
